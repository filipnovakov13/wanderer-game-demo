# Wanderer game / demo
This is a demo of a simple roguelike game written in Java.

##Description:
You have been banished from your land through a portal for 
leading an uprising against the powers that be. You find yourself
in a long lost city of Zarionia. The only knowledge that remains 
of it is legends told by the elders in your town. Once it was a 
capital of a great empire, toppled by it's own greed and evergrowing
thirst for power, leading them to experiment with foul magic.
It is more akin to a desert canyon now, it's only inhabitants
the necromantic skeletons roaming aimlessly. 

##Controls:
- use Arrow UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT or W, S, A, D to move around
- use Space to attack the monsters

##Instructions:
You progress through the area/level by finding the monster that has the 
key (textbox at the bottom of the screen will be yellow when you 
find him) and kill the Boss of that level.
